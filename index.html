            Enid Mary Blyton (11 August 1897 â€“ 28 November 1968) was an English children's writer, whose books have been
            worldwide bestsellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies.
            Her books are still enormously popular and have been translated into 90 languages. As of June 2018, Blyton
            held 4th place for the most translated author.
            She wrote on a wide range of topics, including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical
            narratives, and is best remembered today for her Noddy, Famous Five, Secret Seven, The Five Find Outers, and
            Malory Towers books.
            <br>
            <br>
            Following the commercial success of her early novels, such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) and The
            Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, sometimes producing 50 books a year, in
            addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions.
            Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind: she typed her stories as events
            unfolded before her.
            The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which she produced it led to rumors that Blyton employed an
            army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.
